        <h2>My Cat</h2>
        <p>My Cat's name is Michael boots, but I call him Boots for short. He is an orange shorthair with no teeth. I adopted him after he was found sick on the University of Miami Campus. We are best buds!</p>
        <h2>My Favorite Things to do in Miami</h2>
        <p>My favorite places to go in Miami include the beach, Coconut Grove, Brickell, and Wynwood. In each of these place I like to visit restaurants, try local bars, and enjoy a walk. Miami is a very unique and fun place to live.</p>
        <h2>My Favorite Color</h2>
        <p>My favorite color is yellow because it reminds me of happiness and warmth. When I was young, I decided to paint my walls a pastel yellow, a decision I would later come to regret in my teen years. My favorite color to wear however, is pink. It makes me feel so confident!</p>
